# Google-Job-Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing job data collected from Google's job board in order to analyze which types of jobs are more prominent, 
what skills are most typically sought after with regards to program language and which locations are most frequently hiring. More specifically, 
the goal of this analysis is to visualize these aspects in order to inform future investigation.

## Technologies
The dependencies used are as follows,
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import re
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import cufflinks as cf

Python 3.7.6 and Plotly 4.8.2 are being used in this notebook.
If you have an earlier version of plotly(~3.10.0), there is provisional code 
commented out on line 23 that should assist in viewing the visualizations.
